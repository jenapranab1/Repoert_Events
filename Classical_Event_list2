You can define following thing in domain-

    In Definition Tab
       1.   INITIALIZATION
       2.   AT SELECTION-SCREEN
       3.   START-OF-SELECTION
       4.   TOP-OF-PAGE
       5.   TOP-OF-PAGE DURING LINE SELECTION
       6.   END-OF-PAGE
       7.   END-OF-SELECTION
       8.   GET
       9.   GET LATE


There are different events for list processing interactive reports. They are:
       1.   AT LINE-SELECTION.
       2.    AT USER-COMMAND.
       3.   AT PFn.


The INITIALIZATION event is processed only in the case of SUBMIT, not CALL SELECTION-SCREEN. The END-OF-PAGE event is executed whenever processing reaches that area when formatting a list page or if the RESERVE statement detects that there is insufficient space remaining on the current page. The END-OF-SELECTION event is triggered in type 1 programs once the logical database has finished reading all data and before the list processor is started.

Note: Since INITIALIZATION is only executed once when you start the report, it is not suitable for screen modifications such as suppressing individual parameters.
